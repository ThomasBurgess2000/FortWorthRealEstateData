# FortWorthRealEstateData
Aggregates data from the Tarrant Appraisal District and Redfin to gain insights into housing market.

The program takes all of the residential data from TAD and merges it with Redfin data on the properties that were sold within the last year (price, date sold, and square footage). You can then search this data.

My goal today was just to start aggregating the data, but next steps are finding unique insights from the data, like finding out which areas are consistently undervalued by TAD (which might make it easier to get a deal).

# FortWorthRealEstateData
Aggregates data from the Tarrant Appraisal District and Redfin to gain insights into housing market.

The program takes all of the residential data from TAD and merges it with Redfin data on the properties that were sold within the last year (price, date sold, and square footage). You can then search this data.

My goal today was just to start aggregating the data, but next steps are finding unique insights from the data, like finding out which areas are consistently undervalued by TAD (which might make it easier to get a deal).

**Getting Started**

First you need to clone the repo. 

Second, download whatever year of residential data you want from TAD and save it to the main directory. 

Third, add whatever areas of Redfin data you want to the Redfin folder (it will iterate through all of them).

Fourth, make sure you change your working directory (right before the menu), and you should be set.
